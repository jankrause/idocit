iDocIt!! has been designed and developed in the context of the dissertation-project of [http://nats-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/User/JanChristianKrause Jan Christian Krause] at [http://www.akra.de AKRA GmbH]. 

The Eclipse Plugin has been implemented by Dirk Meier-Eickhoff and is well described in Dirk's bachelor-thesis. AKRA wants to continue iDocIt!'s development together with the open source community. Therefore we published the complete source code here at Google Code under the Apache Licence.
