#summary Documentation of our build process.

= Introduction =

The build-process of iDocIt! should be automated to achieve the following goals:

 # Save time and ensure consistency when releasing a new version of iDocIt!
 # Use the latest development state in projects to collect first experiences with our new features.
 # Identify bugs and side effects through automated tests very early after their implementation.

= Build Process and Architecture=

We use Maven 3 to implement iDocIt!'s build process. The following figure illustrates the default build lifecycle of Maven 3 and the current implementation state of each phase. The default build lifecycle of Maven is described [http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html here] in detail.

The following figure shows the systems and their maintainers participating in the build system. The source code of iDocIt! is hosted by Google at Google Code. At AKRA we have a Hudson instance which checks out the source code and starts the Maven build. After building Maven uploads the Updates to one of iDocIt!'s update sites.

= Implementation =

 * The complete build and upload to an update site is started by executing the command "mvn package -P <PROFILE>" on the parent-project (/trunk/parent-pom).
* <PROFILE> could be "nightly-build" or "release-build". The profiles define the update site to which the binaries are uploaded.
* The user executing Maven must have a settings.xml defining the username and password for server with id "idocit-update-site" (see the following example).
