#summary Documentation of our build process.

= Introduction =

The build-process of iDocIt! should be automated to achieve the following goals:

 # Save time and ensure consistency when releasing a new version of iDocIt!
 # Use the latest development state in projects to collect first experiences with our new features.
 # Identify bugs and side effects through automated tests very early after their implementation.

= Build Process and Architecture=

We use Maven 3 to implement iDocIt!'s build process. The following figure illustrates the default build lifecycle of Maven 3 and the current implementation state of each phase.
