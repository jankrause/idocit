#summary Documentation of our build process.

= Introduction =

The build-process of iDocIt! should be automated to achieve the following goals:

 # Save time and ensure consistency when releasing a new version of iDocIt!
 # Use the latest development state in projects to collect first experiences with our new features.
 # Identify bugs and side effects through automated tests very early after their implementation.

= Build Process and Architecture=

We use Maven 3 to implement iDocIt!'s build process. The following figure illustrates the default build lifecycle of Maven 3 and the current implementation state of each phase. The default build lifecycle of Maven is described [http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html here] in detail.

The following figure shows the systems and their maintainers participating in the build system. The source code of iDocIt! is hosted by Google at Google Code. At AKRA we have a Hudson instance which checks out the source code and starts the Maven build. After building Maven uploads the Updates to one of iDocIt!'s update sites.
