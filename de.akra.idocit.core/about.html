	<p>
		The thematic grids used to classify operations within iDocIt! are based on the work of the Verbnet-team lead by Martha Palmer. Verbnet has been used as a starting point to derive the operation-categories
		empirically from. We thank Martha and her team for the nice and competent support and their pleased answers to all our questions around Verbnet.

		Paul and his colleagues (Felix Bachmann, Len Bass, David Garlan, James Ivers, Reed Little, Robert Nord and Judith Stafford) describe different groups of stakeholders of interface documentation in their great book <a href="http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0201703726">"Documenting Software Architectures - Views and Beyond"</a> (page 237 and following). The groups of stakeholders described there have been used as default addressees within iDocIt!.
